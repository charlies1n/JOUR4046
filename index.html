				<h2>Rising Chinese Domestic Pet Food Brands: The Market Undergoes An Evolution Towards Innovation And
					Standardization </h2>
				<h3>By SHENG An, SIN Peng Chiu, LIU Jiaxuan, and TSANG Chi Ming</h3>
				<ph2 class="major">
					With some young entrepreneurs joining the market, the domestic pet food industry in China dominated
					by imported goods has witnessed a change of landscape, but to sustain their success, they must
					insist on their specialties of innovation and quality assurance.

					<p>Taffee is a brand selling the first-ever “milk tea” tailored for pets in China. Ms. Lanxi Huang,
						an authentic post-95s girl born in Xi’an, founded this brand in 2018, after she graduated from
						college in Australia.
					</p>
					<h3>“I have a strong sense of mission, pushing me to make a specialized type of pet drink to bring
						happiness to my pet,” she said.
					</h3>
					<br>
					<p>In China, the market of domestic pet drinks was still a blank area back then, which rendered it
						quite pioneering for Ms. Huang to create such a brand combining the trendy concept of “milk tea”
						with pet drinks in an innovative way. At first glance, pet owners are easily gravitated towards
						Taffee’s original pet drinks out of curiosity, wondering about the specialty of pets’ “milk
						tea”.
					</p>
					<p>
						In reality, comparing “Miocha” and “Wocha” with other pet drinks in the market, the ingredients
						seem
						to be similar, which consists of nutritions such as goat milk powder and moisture, serving the
						purpose of remedying the disadvantages of pets’ dry and wet grains and solving the problem that
						some
						cats being finicky in terms of drinking water and ordinary milk.
					</p>
					<p>However, while traditional pet drinks serve the purpose of meeting physiological needs, Taffee
						aims to create more fun experiences and emotional connection between pets and pet owners through
						tailored “milk tea”. This innovation sets Taffee apart from other competitive products in the
						market.</p>

					<h3>Ms. Huang said, “What we hope to achieve is to create a sense of happiness and cater to the
						emotional needs of pets.”
					</h3>
					<p>The popularity of Taffee proves Ms. Huang to be incisive in understanding the contemporary
						social trend in China. As a Generation Z (born between 1995 and 2005) herself, she knows that
						this generation is no longer satisfied with ordinary products and is easily attracted to
						products with good-looking appearance and distinctive characteristics. Generation Z’s pet owners
						not only pursue pet snacks with basic attributes, but also seek for those with a social meaning
						that could be disseminated through social media.
					</p>
					<p>Although the Generation Z are gradually becoming a purchasing power of pet food products, they
						only take up a small proportion of China’s pet owners at 5.6%. The Post-80s generation are still
						the major consumers of the pet food industry who are less likely to take interest in delicately
						packaged but less cost effective goods.

					</div>
					<p>Ms. Huang believes that the pet food market is becoming more diversified and subtilized in
						China, providing opportunities for domestic brands to create innovative products which adapt to
						the social trend and keep in line with the mentality of Chinese young people.

					<p>In 2019, pet food holds a large proportion of overall consumption structure in Chinese pet
						industry, which is 61.4%, far more than other categories including medicine and beauty care.
						Among various food subcategories, pet snacks and drinks account for 31.1%, while the staple food
						takes up the largest proportion of 67.7%, suggesting that a more promising economic potential
						for domestic products rests in the area of pet staple food.

					<p>Joyzone could represent those domestic brands aspiring and endeavoring to produce high-quality
						pet staple food. Tara Zhang, the founder and CEO of Joyzone, started her business in the pet
						industry around two months ago, after resigning from Zhen Fund.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tara mentioned the difficulties of producing innovative and distinctive products in the pet
						staple food industry. Different from niche areas such as pet drinks, the manufacturing
						techniques in staple food have already become mature and stable with well-articulated
						international standards. Therefore, instead of following any social trend which is usually
						ephemeral, she prefers to put more effort on how to warrant the high quality of its products in
						each single batch.
					</p>
					<p>
						When it comes to high-quality pet staple food, pet owners in China have more trust in imported
						products.

					<h3>
						“Nowadays the products for cats are much more advanced and expensive than they used to be.” said
						Ms Zhou, a fourth year student at Hong Kong Baptist University who adopted an orange cat
						by accident in Wuhan province one year ago.
					</h3>
					<p>When choosing the food and drink for her cat, she was quite concerned about the nutritions and
						ingredients contained. After listening to suggestions from senior cat keepers and comparing
						several brands by herself, she decided to buy from an imported merchant which produces almost
						the most expensive pet staple food available in the market, with the price at around 520RMB per
						bag.
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/china/gncj/2019-11-14/doc-iihnzhfy9238363.shtml">During the
							“Double 11” e-commerce event in 2019,</a> the most popular imported products is cat
						staple food, while among the top five brands imported to China, foreign brands of cat staple
						food, PETCUREAN GO! and Orijaen, ranked third and fourth respectively. As Huaon’s statistics
						suggests, pet owners in the first and second tier cities in China prefer to buy imported cat
						food rather than domestic cat food.

						From 2015 to April 2020, there are in total 1031 SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) imported pet foods are
						newly registered or renewed by the Ministry of Agriculture. Only in the first quarter of 2020,
						the number of registered imported pet companies reached a new high of 315 Pet food SKU, which
						shows the increasingly fierce competition between imported pet food and domestic pet food.

					<p>
						So far, most domestic pet food brands have been positioning themselves as merchants facing the
						middle and low-end consumer market so that they make profit by selling goods at low prices and
						producing them at even lower expenses by using inferior ingredients and loosening quality
						control. This is one of the reasons why consumers have less trust in the safety of domestic
						food, as a result of which, imported pet food still occupies the domestic market shares.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tara also mentioned that misleading marketing strategies for promotion were likely to inculcate
						consumers with unscientific pet-keeping ideas. In order to cater to some consumers’ demands for
						more lovely appearances, some domestic companies claimed that their food could make pets “grow
						with stud cheeks”. However, such products with this function may do harm to a pet's physical
						health.
					</p>
					<p>Although consumers generally feel more relief to purchase imported pet food, there exists an
						unevenness of quality in each batch of imported products. A cat of Tara’s friend has developed
						kidney atrophy after consuming one imported pet food during the pandemic, which prompted Tara to
						start her own staple food brand.
					</p>
					<h3>
						“I believe that the supply chain in China has already been mature enough,” Tara said, “However,
						domestic consumers need to be educated in order to foster more domestic brands.”
					</h3>
					<p>
						To better regulate the fast-growing pet food market, in September 2019, the Ministry of
						Agriculture in China announced the new policy named Pet Feed Management Measure, to regulate
						domestic pet feed. Before that, there were no specialized rules on pet food production resulting
						in serious food quality issues.
					</p>
					<h3>
						“I believe with more introduction of regulations and rules, the industry would gradually tend to
						form production specialization and market standardization,” Tara said.
